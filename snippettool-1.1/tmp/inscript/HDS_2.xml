                <p>The rock was destroyed in 1995. Only the first horizontal line and part of the
                    second line are still extant. When Kiriya did his transcription on August 20th
                    1995, large parts of the inscription were still intact. See <ref target="Kiriya2003">Kiriya p.67</ref>. Supplements are taken from the same
                    passage in Taisho as well as from Kiriya's transcription.</p>

                <p>Introduction to the passage from the <hi rend="italic">Great Compilation
                    Sūtra</hi> on the Six Perfections.</p>
                <p>For the translator Dharmakṣema (Tanwuchen 曇無讖; 385-433) see the study by Kamata
                    Shigeo 鎌田茂雄1978, p. 80-82. According to tradition, Dharmakṣema was of central
                    Indian birth, and traveled to the Northern Liang 北梁 capital, Guzang 姑臧, in 412
                    where he initially remained until 422. (Chen Jinhua 2004, passim, and especially
                    257-258, following Tang Yongtong, believes that Dharmakṣema arrived in 420. But
                    this contradicts the evidence given in the <hi rend="italic">Biographies of
                        Eminent Monks</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Gao sengzhuan</hi> T # 2059,
                    50:335c16-337b4). After a trip to Khotan, Dharmakṣema is said to have returned
                    to Guzang for a period and then set off once again on a journey to the western
                    regions, during which he was killed in 433. The translation is traditionally
                    dated to 420, though Chen argues that this is impossible and suggests instead
                    that the text dates to the period stretching from 422 to 431 (Chen 2004,
                    257-258). This passage, which also appears on Tieshan within the much larger
                    passage from the Daji jing engraved there, is a discussion of the nature of the
                    Six Perfections (<hi rend="italic">liu boluomi</hi> 六波羅蜜)—Generosity, Precepts,
                    Patience, Vigor, Absorption, and Wisdom—one of the basic maps of Buddhist
                    practice.</p>

                    whole inscription, his reading should be the more probable one. Furthermore, the
                    two Passages in 98 characters of Sutra spoken by Mañjuśrī carved into the south
                    and the north slope also agree with the Three Editions as well as the Old Sung
                    Edition wherever readings of these editions diverge from the Taisho version.</note>
